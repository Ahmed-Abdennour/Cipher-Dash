# Don't remove the assets from the game folder, the game must be run the way it is in the .rar file

# I take full credit for this game's development, and I want to emphasize that Cipher Dash is entirely my original creation. It has never existed before, and I have not borrowed any ideas or algorithms from any other source. This game is a product of my passion and dedication to crafting a unique and enjoyable experience. I hope you'll try it out and appreciate the effort and innovation that went into making Cipher Dash a reality.
